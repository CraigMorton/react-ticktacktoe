# [WIP] react-ticktacktoe
Friday afternoon React recap session. (Cohort 7)

I'm continuing working on this on master. For the code as it was from friday in class [check out this branch](https://github.com/CraigMorton/react-tictactoe/tree/from-friday)

Started making TicTacToe in React on the board on Friday afternoon. To give Cohort 7 a bit of a React recap Q&A.

During the afterrnoon I completed most of the bare-bones of the React-y stuff. And only just got started on the game logic, with the first function.

The code style and how I structure the app may not be consistent with what we covered during lessons, as this was not pre-planned and I wrote it off the top of my head. I naturally drifted towards my own style over the style taught in the rest of the week's lessons.
